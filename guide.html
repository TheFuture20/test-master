This means that if you play in a strategy-oblivious way, you'll not do too bad. But with a good enough strategy, it's actually possible to overcome the house odds, and even make a profit. </p> <p><b>Here's how it works:</b></p> <h4>Instabust</h4> <p> Right off the bat, there's a <b>1%</b> chance of the game instantly busting. If this happens, no one can win anything. This means bustabit.com has an expected return of <code>1% * playersInGame * tableAmount</code>. This is the <b>exact amount</b> bustabit uses to give out bonuses. </p> <h4>House Edge</h4> <p> It scales between 0 and 1% <smaal><a href="/calculator" target="_blank">see: odds and calculator.</a></smaal> This is what you need to overcome! </p> <h4>Bonuses</h4> <p> The last person to <b>cash out</b> before a bust gets a bonus, which on average is exactly the same as the server makes from the instabust <a href="/faq#bonusfunded">see: faq</a>. Strategic play revolves completely around trying to get this bonus. If no one collects the bonus, it <b>rolls to the next game.</b> </p> <h4>Single Player Game</h4> <p> If you're playing a game, and no one else joins, it's not possible to overcome the <b>house odds</b>, and it becomes a simple game of luck. </p> <h4>Simple Greedy Strategy</h4> <p> Hold in the game, as soon as you're the last person holding, cash out immediately. This is a great strategy if all your opponents are conservative, and cash out early. However, if you play against someone with the same strategy -- <b>you will both will infinitely hold, and never win the bonus.</b> </p></div> </div></div></body></html>
